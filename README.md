# studentsdatabase
  Program that allows the user to modify data from a database already made, which respects the rules indicated by the program, or create a new one.

  In this repository is already added an example of file that can be used as an input.

  In matter of implementation, an AVL tree is used to store the students, for efficiency.

  The user is guided at any point with options, menus or notes about what the program is expecting from them.

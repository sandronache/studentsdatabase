# studentsdatabase
Program that allows the user to modify data from a database already made or create a new one, respecting the rules indicated by the program.
In this repository is already added an example of file that can be used as an input. Even if the user decides to use a different file from where the program to start, the rules will be listed so there wouldn't be any confusions for the user.
